\begin{abstract}
This handbook is intended to be a handbook, cheat sheet, and index for inf3410.
I will \emph{try} to keep sentences concise and clean.
My attempt will most likely fail miserably, but some good \emph{may} come
from it.

Important keywords are \textbf{bold} and indexed.

All the to-be-used TODO equations will be listed.

It is not meant to be short and printable, but rather thorough.

NB! I have the american edition of the book, while I know the lecturer
refers to the international one (or the other way around).

NB! I cuss.

TODO what else?
